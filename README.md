Welcome to Vocal Interval Timer!

Quick Backstory: This project was created when group fitness still had a ban in DC because of the C19 pandemic. And the gym I worked in couldn't have official "classes". I suggested we use an interval timer app and just upload audio of ourselves saying the cues. The idea got shot down, but I did find an app like this didn't exist and wanted to build it myself.

So I did it anyway. This app allows you to use the recorder app on your iPhone and upload the files to it. From there you can create intervals and add your own files to the beginning, middle, or end of a cue. Files added to the end of the cue begin playing before the end of the actual interval, we calculate how long it is and subtract it from the total time of the interval so it ends with the interval. 

Eventually I want to recreate a version of this app that's more aesthically appealing, but would also allow people to share and download workouts. Follow-along workout videos are great but you have to keep your phone open and listen to whatver music they have. My app allows you to listen to coaching cues and play your own music.

You can save routines by going to the routine page, hitting create routine, and saving the template. The template on the home screen will automatically be loaded in but can still be edited. 

One issue I have with the app is sometimes, when you load in a pre-made routine the color you assigned an interval will change. It's sporadic and doesn't actually interfere with the app's functionality. I don't plan to fix it because if I do anything else with this app, I will restart from scratch and implement a different state managing system, where the problem is seemingly stemming from.
